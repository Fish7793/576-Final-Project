* Enemy_Spikeball ([link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/shoot-em-up-enemy-spikeball-116938))

All sounds including music were made by Navid using FL Studio and Kontakt with the exception of:
* splash.ogg ([link](https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/water-splashing-20))


## Reflection:
We could have allocated work better and focused on clearer communication when assigning work. Due to the lack of communication Navid made most of the game.
